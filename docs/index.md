# Chief

Chief is a package based cms built on top of the laravel framework.
Chief is solely the back-end(admin panel). You will need to create the front-end yourself.
To install chief we need to install it into another project.
This can be either an existing one or a fresh Laravel 5.6+ project.

## Installment

Chief can be installed via composer.
```php
composer require thinktomorrow/chief
```
The package will automatically register its service provider to hook into your application.

Next edit the application exception handler to extend the chief exception handler.
The Chief Exception handler takes care of the admin authentication and authorization.
In the `App\Exceptions\Handler` file extend the class as such:


```File: App\Exceptions\Handler.php```
```php

use Thinktomorrow\Chief\App\Exceptions\Handler as ChiefExceptionHandler;

class Handler extends ChiefExceptionHandler
```

Add the `AuthenticateChiefSession::class` middleware group to your `App\Http\Kernel` file. This handles the
login sessions of the chief user.

```File: App\Http\Kernel.php```
```php
protected $middlewareGroups = [
    ...
    'web-chief' => [
            AuthenticateChiefSession::class,
    ],
    ...
]
```

### Database

Create a database for your application and perform the migrate artisan command. This will automatically run the chief migrations as well.
Note that Chief has separate tables for the chief admin users, `chief-users` and `chief_password_resets`. This way there
is no interference with your application user logic.

```php
php artisan migrate
```

Next we need at least one main admin user to login and start managing the admin panel.
This command will create the basic roles and permissions and allows to setup the first admin account:

```php
php artisan chief:admin
```

### Config & Assets

The next step is to publish the chief-assets to our public folder.
If you want to overwrite existing files you can add the `--force` flag here.

```php
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=chief-assets
```

Publish the chief config to `config/thinktomorrow/chief` as this will require you to set some application defaults such as
contact email and application name.
```php
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=chief-config
```
Make sure to set at least the `name` value to your project name as it is used in some of the generator commands.

The following vendor assets should also be published to your application:
```php
// The dimsav translatable package
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=translatable
```

# Multilingual

There are a couple of places where you need to configure the localisation of your application.
At the following files you should change the locales to your desired setup:

- Set the available locales of the application in the `config/translatable.php` file. The values in the `locales` array will be available for the admin to manage.
- Set the frontend locales of the application in the `config/thinktomorrow/locale.php` file. The values in this `locales` array will be the allowed locales for the visitors of your application.
- Set the default and fallback locale in the `config/app.php` file. Keep in mind that this value needs to consist of one of the available locales as set in the `config/translatable.php`.

# Changing Chief model behaviour

To change the model behaviour for chief models you can extend the models in your application.

# Project setup advice
Following adjustments are not automatically enforced but are however recommended in your project.

## MySQL index length
Add following snippet in the AppServiceProvider of your project if you use MySQL older than 5.7.7
ref: https://laravel.com/docs/master/migrations#creating-indexes
`Schema::defaultStringLength(191)`

```File: App\Providers\AppServiceProvider.php```
```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

/**
 * Bootstrap any application services.
 *
 * @return void
 */
public function boot()
{
    Schema::defaultStringLength(191);
}
```
